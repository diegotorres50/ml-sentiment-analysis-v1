# Emotion Detection With JavaScript Neural Networks

An example to detect emotions from comments and tweets.

Working with strings in Brain.js is like driving a Maserati at 5mph.
It will let you to do it, but it will be really slow (~2mins for 20k iterations).
We want a Neural Network which takes a string, for example a Tweet, and tells us it’s mood (sadness or gladness?).

That kind of program is called emotion detection.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/diegotorres50/ml-sentiment-analysis-v1.git .
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```
